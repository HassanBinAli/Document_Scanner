# Document_Scanner
This project is written in Opencv.
In this project, a document is scanned using laptop camera (or by supplying already captured image).

Images like   ==> credit cards
              ==> university cards
              ==> documents
              can be scanned easily.
              
The perspective of the image is set to a rectangular shaped object (using 'get_warp' function in code) irrespective of the position of document placed in front of camera.
And this gives the feel of a scanned document.
